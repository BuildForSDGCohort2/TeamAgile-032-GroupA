Year after year, there are alarming reports of families losing members to the indecent trades of humans by humans. where humans are indiscriminately trafficked to far distant farms and locations against their own will. 

My teams project is inspired by the trouble these events cause families every year and the bad reputation it gives to different countries as a result of the Human trafficking been perpetuated in their countries unknown to the Nationals, where we have designed a project that will actively track perpetrators and locations of this hidden trade.

Our App allows anyone who had been a victim of human trafficking, regardless of their Location, Literacy Ability or Emergency Position to quickly reach out to the outside world and World Agencies regarding their currently situations by making quick videos or writing an article with possible information about the reported hidden that can easily be tracked to them.
